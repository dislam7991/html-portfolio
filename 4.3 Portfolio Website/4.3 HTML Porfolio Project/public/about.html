<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Daniel – a driven and curious individual dedicated
   to achieving excellence in every facet of life. With a 
   strong background in network engineering, chemical engineering and research and development 
   in nutrition, I’m now focused on advancing my skills in software engineering, AI, and 
   cloud technologies to build a stable and impactful career in a rapidly evolving industry.</p>

<p>Beyond my professional pursuits, fitness and self-improvement are at the core 
  of who I am. Since discovering the transformative power of strength training 
  and bodybuilding in 2015, I’ve committed myself to becoming the strongest, healthiest, 
  and most resilient version of myself – both physically and mentally. I’m fueled by a 
  relentless desire to grow and push the boundaries of my capabilities, overcoming past 
  struggles to embrace every challenge with determination.</p>

<p>In my personal life, I’m a devoted husband striving to be the best partner I can be,
  balancing a full-time job with my journey into tech while fostering meaningful connections 
  and growth with my wife. I’m deeply rooted in my faith, which has been my guiding light through 
  life’s ups and downs, and it continues to inspire my pursuit of excellence.</p>

<p>I’m excited to bring my passion, resilience, and problem-solving skills into 
  the tech industry while building a fulfilling life that prioritizes health, connection, 
  and growth. Welcome to my portfolio – let’s level up together!</p>
