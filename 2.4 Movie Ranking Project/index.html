<h1>The Best Movies According to Daniel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pacific Rim</h3>
<p>Robots fighting monsters. What more could you want?</p>
<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>Humans fighting giant humans... or so we thought.</p>
<h3>Blade Runner: 2049</h3>
<p>A visually stunning movie that delves into themes of what it means to be "alive", the nature of memory and identity, and the moral complexities of creating sentient life.</p>
